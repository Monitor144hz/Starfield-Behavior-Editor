# Starfield-Behavior-Editor
WIP Editor for Starfield agx behavior files.
## What is Behavior?
Behavior is a term derived from Skyrim's 2010 Havokâ„¢ Behavior middleware, which is an animation logic system constructed through non-deterministic finite state machines. It can be thought of as a more primitive version of Unreal blueprints dedicated to character locomotions and animation. 

Starfield uses its own in-house behavior solution rather than Havok, but many of the concepts remain transferable. This is a program that can open and edit these files in a graph UI.
